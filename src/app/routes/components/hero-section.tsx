          <p>
            I&apos;m a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on
            creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital
            experiences that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and
            responsive. Even though I have been creating web applications for
            over 7 years, I still love it as if it was something new.
